## üìÅ Git Repository Structure

Implement your project using **multiple Git repositories** (private):

1. **Application Repository**
   - Purpose: Manage source code and CI/CD workflows
2. **Infrastructure Repository**
   - Purpose: Manage Terraform code for AWS infrastructure
3. **Cluster Resources Repository**
   - Purpose: Manage Kubernetes YAMLs and Helm Charts  
   - (Later include your own Helm chart for the application)

---

## üß≠ Architecture Diagrams

Create **two primary diagrams**:

### üß± 1. 2-Tier Application Architecture

- Frontend/Backend
- Database (MongoDB)

### üîÑ 2. Complete Workflow Architecture

Include:
- Git repositories
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- AWS infrastructure components
- Kubernetes deployment: Application + supporting services

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Application Development

You may choose one of the following application approaches:

### Option 1: DemoCRM (MongoDB)
- Based on the provided `demo-crm-main.zip`
- Perform minor refactoring from the original repo

### Option 2: Fork WorkProfile (MySQL)

### Option 3: Build Your Own Application
Use a simple REST API service that interacts with a database.  
**Example Endpoints**:
- `GET /person`: Return list of people (JSON)
- `POST /person/{id}`: Add a new person to the database

> üîπ _Note: The application is **not** the main focus of the project._

---

## üê≥ Docker Implementation

- Create a **Dockerfile** for efficient runtime image
- Write a `docker-compose.yaml` for:
  - Local development (app + database)
  - End-to-end testing environment (mimicked in CI)

---

## üîÅ CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions

Target only the `main` branch (production).

### üéØ Workflow Stages:

1. Clone/Pull code
2. Build the application
3. Unit tests (mocked)
4. Package Docker image
5. End-to-end testing (mocked)
6. Deploy testing environment (`docker compose up`)
7. Run API endpoint tests (GET, POST, DELETE)
8. Tear down test environment
9. Push image to ECR
10. Deploy new version to your environment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Production environments are delicate‚Äîstart with single-branch (`main`) workflows only.

---

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Setup

- Use **Terraform** to deploy an **EKS cluster on AWS**
- Node type: `t3a.medium` (1 node)
- Deploy application and microservices manually
- Expose the Deployment with a Kubernetes Service to allow public access

---

## üóÇ Project Management Tips

- Use **Trello** to track tasks and define priorities
- Focus on mandatory requirements first
- Start with diagrams for better planning
- The application itself is a means to demonstrate the platform‚Äîkeep it simple
- Reach out to mentors if using additional tools/resources
